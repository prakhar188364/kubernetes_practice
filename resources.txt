Notes- 
Node is machine, also called as minion. 
Cluster is a set of node, used in load balancing.
Master node does orchestration for worked node. 

Worker Node -> have continer runtime server -> Kubelet

Master Node -> apiserver thst speak to workers kubelet agent.
master also have    etcd  - Responsible to store key value pair
                    controller - Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down. 
                    scheduler - etermines which Nodes are valid placements for each Pod in the scheduling queue according to constraints and available resources.


Docker vs ContainderD- 
Older block usually have docker, new use word ContainderD
before Kubernetes ERA Docker use to work with container then came Kubernets to orchestrate docker. Docker & Kubernetes were tightly coupled & k8s use to work with docker only. 
Then k8s releases CRI (Container runtime interface) which follows OCI (open container Initiative) - imagespec
                                                                                                    runtimespec
Since docker was not follwing OCI, it release dockershim. 
docker already offering CLI, API, BUILD, Volumes, Auth, Security, ContainderD. 
ContainderD is compatable with CRI, it is a seperate runtime. Since ContainderD was working directly so docker decided to get rid of dockershim after v1.24.
ContainderD is seperate project by own now. you can just install ContainderD alone without Docker.

ContainderD- 
CTR/nerdctl - It offer CTR cmd but very limited features. So as the alternate there is other offer like nerdctl, it offer almost all feature of docker and beyond docker. 
almost all docker cmd work with nerdctl cmd also. 

CRICTL - it belong to k8s community, work with all CRI compatable runtimes. feature is limited, mostly for debugging. it work along with kubelet. used only for specific cmds. 
docker cmd work same here. it also track pods that docker doesn't.
